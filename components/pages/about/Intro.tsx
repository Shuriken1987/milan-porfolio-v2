      My journey into the world of computers began in my final year before
      high school when I enrolled in a technical school majoring in
      computer technology. It was there that I was first introduced to
      programming through C++, sparking a deep interest in the field. This
      led me to enroll in a year-long bootcamp focused on PHP development,
      where I further honed my backend programming skills.
